Why CMSC320?
	There exists a symbiotic relationship between the fields of mathematics and computer science that became apparent when I first took a Discrete Structures course. Concepts learnt in this class such as set theory, combinatorics and graph theory are fundamental mathematical concepts. Remarkably these concepts simultaneously serve as a language through which algorithms, data structures and computational processes can be expressed. This course became one of the main motivators behind me beginning my journey as a Computer Science and Mathematics student at University of Maryland. In order for a career that allows me to work with both of these interesting fields is data science, and I saw how the course curriculum aligned to meet my goal as a data scientist.
